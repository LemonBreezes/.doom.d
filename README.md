# .doom.d
My private doom-emacs config:

My editing style is evil but with the built-in undo system of Emacs (I patched undo-tree out of evil and doom-emacs due to history corruption issues). I also use a descendent of this keyboard layout http://thedarnedestthing.com/colemak%20mod-xvcf on a programmable mechanical keyboard.
